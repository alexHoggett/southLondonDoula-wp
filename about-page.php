        <h2>Motherhood</h2>
        <p>As a young parent, mothering ran parallel with my first experiences of adulthood and I could not be more grateful for this. Becoming a mother awoke a curiosity; my need to ask the important questions and to search deep within myself to answer them authentically.</p>
        <p>My own birthing and early motherhood experiences evoked my interest in becoming more informed about problematic societal views on women, birthing people and parenthood, especially the effects these attitudes have on minority families and their babies. The more I learned about these common issues, the deeper my desire to support and advocate for women and birthing people became.</p>
        <p>As a doula and mother myself I believe that only through loving our parents, ensuring their healing, empowerment, support and hence supporting their ability to love, nurture and care, will we see the change that we wish to see in the world.</p>

        <p>My awareness of the disparities women and birthing people can face within maternity care soon led me to training, volunteering and working as a Breastfeeding Counsellor for the Breastfeeding Network. Over eight years in this post has allowed me the opportunity to support hundreds of families through their feeding journeys in my local community as well as nationally on the breastfeeding helpline. Engaging closely with women immediately after birth has been an immensely rewarding experience. It is a privilege to provide a specialised service and witness women and birthing people discover their power in feeding their babies and overcoming initial challenges. However, I often felt a desire to be involved with families earlier on in their journeys which is why I felt called to become a doula.</p>

          <p>I embarked on my path to becoming a birth keeper in 2016 by studying with Paramana doula, a course led by internationally renowned obstetrician Michel Odent and experienced London doula, Lilliana Lammers. The inspiration and knowledge I gained with them cemented my passion to support birthing people in their transition through pregnancy, birth and parenthood. My hope is to nourish mothers’ and parents' connections with themselves and to the intrinsic design of birthing. Expanding this creative ability gives birth to ideas, expressions, dreams, lives and human existence. </p>

        <p>Along the way, I have trained as a Developmental Infant Massage Teacher and Babywearing Peer Supporter, facilitated baby massage workshops, volunteered in sling libraries, had involvement with breastfeeding awareness campaigns, events and films. I have completed specific lactation support training and am working towards qualifying as a Lactation Consultant. I volunteer on the <a href="www.nationalbreastfeedinghelpline.org.uk/" target="_blank">National Breastfeeding Helpline</a> and with volunteer doula organisations supporting families with financial or other difficulties including <a href="www.neighbourhooddoulas.org/" target="_blank">Neighbourhood doulas</a> and Doula UK access fund.</p>
        <p>I frequently attend study days, training, conferences and workshops to stay up to date and further my knowledge. Most importantly I continue to deepen my practice as an empathic doula and learn the most from the awesome families and fellow birth workers I meet.</p>

      <p>I offer to walk alongside you on this journey, spiritual and information support extend over the full varied experience of pregnancy, abortion, loss/ early birth, birth, postpartum and transition to parenting.
      </p>
      <p>Throughout human history women, birthing families have consistently sought warmth, direction, and wisdom from their familial circles to centre themselves during transitions in life. The way in which we grow our babies, birth them and raise them has enormous influence on our lives, our babies’ development and a reflection of our society as a whole. I understand the power that birth and postpartum has to make or break bonds, to heal ourselves, to have a reach far greater, heal deep wounds in our societies and establish a base for our future generations to build from. Being such an intimate and powerful time the guidance of those with experience can be grounding and encourage us to remember our primal strengths when it comes to birth and parenting. </p>
      <p>I offer to walk alongside you on this journey. It is an honour to be present and witness you discovering your intuitive wisdom and power. My focus is to provide active listening and empathic space to explore your inner experience of this transition and the options available to you. Cultural and queer competency threads deeply into my care, I strive for ongoing learning and aim to work from a trauma-aware, gender-inclusive and anti-oppressive space for all. </p>
      <p>My doula offerings of emotional, practical, spiritual and information support extend over the full varied experience of pregnancy, abortion, loss/ early birth, birth, postpartum and transition to parenting. </p>
      <p>I have experience supporting birth/ breastfeeding trauma, solo parents, LGBTQ+ families, gestational diabetes, multiples, loss, early birth, induction, elective caesarean, emergency caesarean, VBAC (vaginal birth after caesarean) and those with more complex medical needs including physical restrictions and disabilities. I support births at home, in birth centres and in labour wards.</p>
