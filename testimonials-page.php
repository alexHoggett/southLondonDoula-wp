          <p class="testimonial__quote  quote">Robyn is nothing short of fantastic - she helped me in the first 4 weeks of motherhood and I can honestly say I would not be the mum I am now if not for her! Her knowledge of all things baby is vast, including breastfeeding and baby wearing, and she's able to impart in a very unobtrusive way - empowering you to make your own decisions and have a far better understanding of your baby.</p>

          <p class="testimonial__quote  quote">As a partner, I found Robyn to be an exceptional doula. She was engaging, friendly, intuitive and supportive. Despite the uncertainty caused by the pandemic Robyn provided a calming and stable presence which enabled my partner and I to remain equally calm. I don’t think Robyn proffered advice throughout the pregnancy but instead listened, asked thoughtful and considered questions and then supported us with any decision that we made.
          Our birth process did not go as we had first envisaged. However, with Robyn’s support, and the techniques that she enabled us to develop, my partner and I could see the birthing process in a far more positive way than we may have otherwise. I don’t know if one recommends a doula, or if it’s appropriate as it depends on you and what you are looking for. But from our experience, it was wonderful having Robyn by our side and on our side.</p>

          <p class="testimonial__quote  quote">When I first met with Robyn I felt able to share my personal circumstances with her completely, which (as a single mama) helped me feel able to have her completely as part of my journey. Before the birth we had time to go through my birthing preferences and complete a visual birth plan. This was a very comprehensive process and no question was too simple for her. This made me feel informed, confident and comfortable - much more so than I did with any statutory support. In labour Robyn was on hand and her usual calm and knowledgeable self. I'll alway remember a moment of advocacy in the labour where she reinforced my wishes while I was labouring - something I could hear but not fully focus on or appreciate at the time. Even though my sister was also present, it was so helpful hearing them discuss my wishes and wait for my input when I felt the energy to be able. At no point were any decisions made without me and it feels like that could have been different without her. During labour and after, Robyn was a hugely useful source of information but also a caring listening ear. She helped me with our first bath for bubba and even shared her wisdown when having some feeding issues some time down the line. I always felt listened to, supported and always in control and having Robyn there through a long pregnancy and a long and little bit challenging labour was incredibly reassuring, positive and healthy! I would highly recommend Robyn to anyone that's unsure about having a Doula and sending love and wellness your way!</p>

          <p class="testimonial__quote quote">Robyn was a great support during the last weeks of my pregnancy, she talked to me and my partner about the choices we had, but most important was her determination to focus on what we wanted and how we wanted the birth to be. She guided me to write a birth plan that was changing as the birth was approaching due to my personal circumstances. At the end I had an elected C-session and Robyn was there to help me write my birth plan for the C- session that included lowering the screen and seeing the baby coming,  immediately skin to skin contact and a delayed umbilical cord clamping. I have to thank Robyn for her support that made that unforgettable moment happier and fulfilling.</p>

          <p class="testimonial__quote quote">After speaking to a few candidates we chose Robyn to be our birth and postnatal doula – and we are so happy we did! Robyn is a very professional and knowledgeable doula, and her warm and grounded personality made us feel at ease in the process of becoming parents. Her support and guidance were exactly what we were hoping for and we are truly grateful for the positive influence she had. Robyn helped us plan for a homebirth and was with us for the delivery. It was quite a long and tiring labour and we were so grateful and inspired that Robyn’s support was absolute throughout. Even staying longer than expected to help put back the room for us and make placenta prints. We have some excellent photos and videos too, shot by Robyn, to keep hold of. We honestly believe we would not have been able to have such a wholesome and positive experience without her help. Our postnatal sessions were hugely valuable helping us become quickly comfortable caring for our baby. Robyn is an excellent guide with lots of insights into the many details new parents have to learn such as breastfeeding, bathing, sling use, pumping milk, soothing, etc. Always calm and reassuring, she emits such a caring and empathetic energy. This feels like something particular to Robyn. That her knowledge and professionalism are carried by an approach that is empowering, therapeutic and kind. If we have another baby, we will definitely ask Robyn to be there again. She played a crucial role part in welcoming Percy into our lives and would love her to be there when welcoming new members of our family to the world! </p>

          <p class="testimonial__quote quote">Robyn is a wonderful doula. She has a very non-judgmental, empathic approach and is a great listener. It's hard to imagine that I would have had the home birth I had without her. She provided so much support not only to me but to my partner too and I know he felt more equipped to support me as a result. Robyn shared so much knowledge with us in the first few weeks after birth when we worked with her for a short time as a postnatal doula and I believe my breastfeeding journey was able to get off to such a successful start because of her support and guidance. She also has great knowledge around slings, and we were able to use one very early on and build confidence in doing this with her guidance.</p>

          <p class="testimonial__quote quote">Where to begin! Robyn is just incredible in every way. There’s really no one like her. I struggled with breastfeeding my first child so I sought Robyn’s help for my second. Immediately she made me feel calm and comfortable. Her presence alone took me to a better place. She really listens and always had words of wisdom for anything I was struggling with; as well as videos, articles, materials, etc.., that were all extremely useful. I’ve spent many hours trying to find answers on the internet and Robyn has done all of that work already. I was blown away by her passion for what she does and her wealth of knowledge. She’s supportive, brilliant, peaceful, caring, patient, humble, and so much more. I’m so very grateful to have had Robyn, and her lovely daughter, on my motherhood journey with me. </p>

          <p class="testimonial__quote quote">Robyn has been an asset throughout my postnatal period. She has supported in my breastfeeding journey and allowed me to feel human in the days following giving birth which I did not think could happen. If you are thinking about getting a doula then I could not recommend Robyn more. I miss her in my home already!</p>
