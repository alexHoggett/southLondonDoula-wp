    <p class="page-intro">Welcoming new life into the world should be a moment of empowerment, euphoria and celebration, however too often this momentous occasion is clouded by fear, disappointment and undesirable traumatic outcomes in the birthing room. You should not be expected to go into your birth experience feeling unprepared, vulnerable or anxious. Becoming a mother or parent can be one of the most significant events in a person’s life, you should feel nothing short of empowered, knowledgeable and confident. I believe the role of a doula can support this.</p>

      <p class="section__intro">I truly believe women and birthing people have the ability to grow and birth peacefully, physiologically and without much interference from a clinical perspective. I believe in individualised birthing, that the birthing person’s voice is the most important in the room and they should be supported to birth the way they wish to. ​I understand that unforeseen circumstances result in the necessity for undesired medical intervention and am extremely thankful for these resources being available to the women, birthing people and babies that rely on them. That being said, I do not support interventions which are suggested due to hospital policy rather than strong evidence-based information and research.</p>

        <p>During pregnancy most of the focus is directed towards preparing for labour and birth, but what happens afterward when you have your sweet baby in your arms and need to settle in at home?</p>
        <p>The postnatal period is the time in which you discover your baby, yourself as parent/mother and slowly adjust to the new life you now have. This experience requires time, patience and a well-informed support network (i.e. sometimes well-meaning family and friends need to be educated on how best to support you!). Self-care can often be overlooked during this time due to attending to the immediate needs of a newborn. Thinking about what might make life easier in your pregnancy is a great idea to be well prepared for postpartum.</p>
        <p>I really encourage my clients to do nothing but bond and care for their babies during the early weeks; allow your body to rest, heal and recover from the enormous and amazing job of giving birth. There is nothing more important than prioritising your mental space, emotions and physical recovery – the first few months lay the foundation of how parents and baby’s first year together play out. Of course, much of it is unpredictable but there are some steps you can take to help this babymoon time go as smoothly as possible.</p>

          <p>I have worked as a Nanny since 2014 caring for young babies and children providing holistic care to my families, I adored building relationships and still hold friendships with them many years on.

My role is guided by your needs but some of my care may include the following:</p>
          <p>Similar to birth doulas, a postnatal doula's role is to protect your postnatal oxytocin-love-bubble at home.

      <p class="margin__side--medium">I am a trained and registered Breastfeeding Counsellor with a nationally recognised charitable
        organisation and can, therefore, support you with breastfeeding as a doula. It is the very essence
        of the Breastfeeding Network organisation that support is offered free of charge, that support is
        free from any commercial influence and that the organisation is accessible to all. It is crucial that these principles are upheld and are seen to be upheld. It is therefore not possible to act as a doula and a BfN Breastfeeding Counsellor for the same person. I can, however, support you in your feeding with the skills and knowledge from my counsellor role. Therefore, if you require help, support or information from the BfN, you can access that free of charge through the National Breastfeeding Helpline on 0300 100 0212 which connects parents with an ABM (Association of Breastfeeding Mothers) or BfN Breastfeeding
        Counsellor.</p>

      <p class="margin__side--medium">You can see more information about the BfN and National Breastfeeding Helpline <a href="https://www.breastfeedingnetwork.org.uk/ and https://www.nationalbreastfeedinghelpline.org.uk/ ">here</a></p>

      <p class="margin__side--medium">I have supported families through positioning and attachment, thrush, mastitis, blocked ducts, feeding multiples, balancing mixed feeding and those exclusively expressing and bottle feeding. As part of my postnatal care, I use my knowledge to support my clients with infant feeding, including responsive bottle feeding. I work to ensure appropriate feeding support is available to all, this includes signposting to free services local to you.</p>

          <p><span class="background--apricot">Using a sling, wrap or baby carrier is a beautiful way to facilitate nature's intrinsic design by keeping babies close in their natural habitat (your chest), by keeping them close while still being able to navigate the demands of day to day life. Knowing how to safely and comfortably wear your baby in a sling can be a key tool in moving through the fourth trimester especially, and even beyond to preschooler years when closeness is often desired by teething, unwell, tired or upset children.</span></p>
          <p><span class="background--apricot">As a trained babywearing peer counsellor I am able to discuss sling safety, the types of carriers available and which may be best suited to your needs. I hugely advocate for comfort and safety over types or branding. I have experience volunteering at sling libraries (places you can browse and try various slings for free!), working in a baby wearing boutique and years of personal experience carrying my own dear love as well as clients' babies.</span></p>
