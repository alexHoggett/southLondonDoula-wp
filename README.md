This is a WordPress theme adapted from a static site built for SouthLondoDoulaâ„¢. The original site was constructed entirely using custom HTML and SASS, which made it challenging to adjust every component for a dynamic, responsive WordPress component. Due to time constraints, I focused on making smaller elements adjustable by the CMS, while leaving the majority of the content static. The foundational work for a wordpress theme was completed, however, the theme still has room for further development.

## ðŸ›  Installation and Setup
This theme can be installed directly as a wordpress custom theme. 

To run this theme locally for development follow theses steps:

1. Download [Local](https://localwp.com/)
2. Open Local and add a new site
3. Choose 'Create a new site'
4. Choose your site name and create an account to login with
5. Locate your 'Local Sites' folder on your hard-drive (on Mac this is in your root directory)
6. Add this theme to the path `Local Sites/[Site Name]/app/public/wp-content/themes` in its own folder, the folder name will be the name of the theme.
7. Back in Local, select 'WP Admin' on your site and you will be taken to the admin page
8. From here you can now select the theme that you just added.
